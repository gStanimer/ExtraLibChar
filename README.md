# Extra Liberty Characterization
---
Extra Liberty Characterization (ELC) is the new AI solution to the long-standing problem of .lib LUT extrapolation.
Standard cell characterization is a crucial step in chip manufacturing, as timing/power measurements for all standard cells
of a technology node are extracted directly from the foundry. However, such measurements can improve technology files only
to a certain point and are not able to cover each scenario the library is going to be used in.
---
ELC is an open-source tool aiming to contribute towards this issue, by utilizing AI to properly predict standard cell behaviour
in terms of timing for conditions not covered by the library LUTs.
